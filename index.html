    <h2>Question No-1</h2>
    <h3>Difference  between div and span</h3>
    <pre style="font-size: 16px;">
        Div stands for division. It means that div tag defines a division or section in HTML document.
        It is a block-level element which means it acquires whole width of the screen.
        So the next element will always come in next line. It can be used to style blocks of the content.
        Whereas Span tag is an inline element, it acquires only the width which is required for the
        content so the next element will be starting from the same line only.It can be used to style parts
        of the text.

    <h2>Question No-2</h2>
    <h3>Difference between class and IDs</h3>
    <pre style="font-size: 16px;">
        Class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple elements can share the
        same class. It is often used to point to a class name in style sheet. For style an element, We
        use class="box" OR .box{} . One element can have more than one class.
        ID attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element. Single element can share only
        one specific id. It is often to point to a style declaration in style sheet. For style an element,
        We use id="heading" OR #heading. One element can have only one id.

    <h3>What are self closing tag</h3>
    <pre style="font-size: 16px;">
        A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not be closed by closing tag, which means there is
        no separate closing tag for it as </tag>. 
        An regular element contains opening tag , closing tag and content. But Self closing tag contains
        opening tag and content.

        of heading tags are there in HTML.

    <h2>Question No-5</h2>
    <h3>Difference between block and inline</h3>
    <pre style="font-size: 16px;">
        An HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. There are
        two type of display values.
        Block elements acquire the entire width of the screen which means it always starts on a new line
        and browsers automatically add some space line and after the element.
        Examples:- div tag, p tag, table tag etc.
        Inline elements acquire only width required for the content which means it does not start on a
        new line.
        Examples:- anchor tag , span tag, image tag, input tag etc.

    <h2>Question No-6</h2>
    <h3>Difference between em and strong</h3>
    <pre style="font-size: 16px;">
        The strong and em tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text.
        The strong tag should be used to indicate strong importance. It makes text look bold.
        i.e. <strong>Text</strong>
        The em tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the
        emphasized text in a different tone of voice. This also makes the text look bold, but
        if you are using Google dictation then it will read the text with a little emphasis. 
        i.e <em>Text</em>
